MultiEncoder
============

MultiEncoder is a simple GUI tool to convert text data into a variety of encoded
formats. Currently binary, octal, hex, base32 and base64 encoding formats are 
supported. It is also possible to decode an encoded data into its raw text format
as well as other supported encoding formats.

This tool is inspired by the Translator, Binary on-line tool available at
https://paulschou.com/tools/xlate/ and written in Java for local execution across
different platforms.
